  <h2>Jump Fighters</h2>
    <p>A 2D fighting game which pits popular anime characters, from different anime series, against each other. As an avid fan of anime and video games I wanted to create something that demonstrated my love for both of these mediums. This was built using Javascript and incorporated Phaser 3 as a framework.

  <h2>Gamer Grade</h2>
    <p>A rating website made for video games done by gamers. I made this website with the intention to have gamers provide reviews for games rather than companies since I felt like the opinions I wanted to hear were from fellow gamers who played games because they wanted to, not because their boss forced them to play a game they had no interest in. I built this using Express and PostgreSQL.

  <h2>Game Launch</h2>
    <p>A gamer networking site made to connect gamers across all their different platforms. My group and I were inspired to make this as we noticed a problem with gaming these days. There are so many places to play games on, but communicating accross all these platforms can be difficult. Thats why we wanted to make a site that centralized communication for gamers. This project was made using React and Express w/ MongoDB.

  <h2>Animania</h2>
    <p>A place where you can search for anime set up your own watchlist. As someone who watchesa a fair bit of anime I wanted to make a website celebrating anime that users would find useful and entertaining to use. This project was made using React and Express w/ MongoDB. <a class = 'link' target='_blank' href="https://animania-client.herokuapp.com/"> Link to website </a></p>
